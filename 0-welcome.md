To highlight some code in your sentence use the 
back-tick (left leaning apostrophe) around the code 
like this `x = 42`

If you have a block of code you want to show, use three back-ticks
before and after the code.  If you put the name of the programming 
language after the fourth back-ticks, then it will highlight the 
syntax for you:

```python
x = 3
y = 7
z = x * y
print(z)
```

To put text in italics, use a single star:  *i am italics*
To put text in bold, use two stars: **i am bold**

To create a link use the format: 
[Text to Display](filename or link)

To display a picture use the format: 
![Alternate Text to Display](filename or link)

To display a table, use hyphens and pipes (vertial bars):

header 1 | header 2 | header 3
-------- | -------- | --------
value 11 | value 21 | value 31
value 12 | value 22 | value 32
value 13 | value 23 | value 33
